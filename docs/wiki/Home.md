# Padlock Wiki

Welcome to the Padlock Wiki! This wiki provides comprehensive documentation about the Padlock project, a post-quantum encoding utility for secure data archiving.

## What is Padlock?

Padlock is a high-performance K-of-N threshold data encoding and decoding utility that implements a one-time-pad scheme for secure data archiving and border-crossings. It was created by Ray Ozzie as a post-quantum encryption solution.

Padlock provides information-theoretic security by splitting data into encrypted output collections where only a subset of those collections is required to recover the original content. By relying solely on secure random number generation and XOR operations, Padlock achieves high security while remaining straightforward and fully streamable.
