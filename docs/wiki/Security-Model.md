# Padlock Security Model

Padlock implements a robust security model based on information theory rather than computational hardness assumptions. This approach provides security that is mathematically provable and resistant to advances in computing power, including quantum computers.

## Information-Theoretic Security

Unlike traditional cryptographic systems that rely on the computational difficulty of certain mathematical problems (like factoring large numbers or computing discrete logarithms), Padlock uses a one-time pad approach that provides information-theoretic security.

### Perfect Secrecy

When implemented correctly, Padlock achieves perfect secrecy as defined by Claude Shannon:

- With fewer than K collections, an attacker gains absolutely no information about the original data, regardless of their computational resources.
- This security is not based on the difficulty of a mathematical problem but on the fundamental properties of information theory.
- The security is mathematically provable rather than relying on assumptions about computational hardness.

### Key Properties

1. **Threshold Security**: Data is split into N collections where any K collections can reconstruct the original data, but K-1 or fewer collections reveal nothing.

2. **One-Time Pad**: The system uses truly random keys combined with XOR operations, which provides perfect secrecy when implemented correctly.

3. **No Key Management**: Unlike traditional encryption, there are no encryption keys to manage or store securely.

4. **Post-Quantum Security**: The security is unaffected by quantum computing advances that threaten traditional cryptographic methods.

## Threshold Scheme Implementation

The K-of-N threshold scheme is implemented using a combination of one-time pads and combinatorial mathematics.

### Mathematical Foundations

For a system with N collections where any K are needed:

1. There are C(N,K) = N!/(K!(N-K)!) possible combinations of K collections.
2. Each collection participates in exactly C(N-1,K-1) different combinations.
3. The system creates a set of equations where:
   - With K or more collections, the system of equations is solvable
   - With fewer than K collections, the system is underdetermined and has infinitely many solutions

### XOR Operations

The core of the implementation uses XOR operations, which have several important properties:

1. **Reversibility**: A ⊕ B ⊕ B = A (XORing twice with the same value returns the original)
2. **Commutativity**: A ⊕ B = B ⊕ A
3. **Associativity**: (A ⊕ B) ⊕ C = A ⊕ (B ⊕ C)
4. **Identity**: A ⊕ 0 = A
5. **Self-Inverse**: A ⊕ A = 0

These properties allow for the creation of a system where:
- Original data is XORed with random pads
- The resulting values are distributed across collections
- With K collections, the original data can be reconstructed
- With fewer than K collections, the result is statistically indistinguishable from random data

## Random Number Generation

The security of the system depends entirely on the quality of randomness used. Padlock implements a defense-in-depth approach to random number generation.

### Multi-Source RNG Architecture

Padlock combines five independent sources of entropy:

1. **Go's crypto/rand**: Cryptographically secure random number generator provided by Go
2. **System Entropy**: Direct access to `/dev/urandom` for system-provided entropy
3. **Time-Based Entropy**: Microsecond-precision timing information
4. **Hardware-Specific Entropy**: CPU and system-specific information
5. **Process-Specific Entropy**: Process ID and other runtime variables

This approach ensures that even if some sources are compromised or predictable, the overall randomness remains strong.

### Entropy Mixing

The entropy from different sources is mixed using cryptographic hash functions and XOR operations to ensure that:

1. All bits of the output are influenced by all sources
2. Weaknesses in one source do not compromise the overall security
3. The output passes statistical randomness tests

## Security Considerations

### Critical Security Requirements

1. **Never Reuse Collections**: Each set of collections must be used exactly once. Reusing collections violates the one-time pad security principle and can lead to complete compromise.

2. **Physical Separation**: Collections should be stored in separate physical locations to reduce the risk of compromise.

3. **Secure Deletion**: After use, collections should be securely deleted to prevent unauthorized reconstruction.

4. **Quality of Randomness**: The system is only as secure as its random number generator. Compromised randomness can lead to predictable outputs.

### Potential Vulnerabilities

While the mathematical security of the threshold scheme is provable, implementation details can introduce vulnerabilities:

1. **Side-Channel Attacks**: Timing information, power consumption, or electromagnetic emissions during processing might leak information.

2. **Implementation Errors**: Bugs in the code could potentially compromise security properties.

3. **Metadata Leakage**: File names, sizes, or timestamps might reveal information about the encoded data.

4. **Human Factors**: Improper use, such as reusing collections or storing them together, can compromise security.

## Security Comparison with Traditional Encryption

| Aspect | Traditional Encryption | Padlock |
|--------|------------------------|---------|
| Security Basis | Computational hardness | Information theory |
| Quantum Resistance | Vulnerable (except PQC algorithms) | Resistant |
| Key Management | Required | Not required |
| Perfect Secrecy | No | Yes (with proper implementation) |
| Threshold Recovery | No | Yes |

| Vulnerability to Algorithm Breaks | Yes | No |
| Vulnerability to Implementation Errors | Yes | Yes |

## Verification and Validation

The security properties of Padlock can be verified through:

1. **Mathematical Proof**: The information-theoretic security of the threshold scheme can be mathematically proven.

2. **Statistical Testing**: The randomness of the output can be verified using statistical tests.

3. **Code Review**: The implementation can be reviewed to ensure it correctly implements the mathematical properties.

4. **Formal Verification**: Formal methods can be applied to verify the correctness of the implementation.
